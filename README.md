# 🚀 Kiwi — Powered by AdSync Engine

> A next-gen smart eCommerce platform that understands user behavior and delivers personalized product ads with dynamic pricing.

---

## 🧠 What is Kiwi?

Kiwi is not a normal eCommerce website.

It is a **behavior-driven intelligent shopping system** powered by our custom-built **AdSync Engine**, which tracks user interactions and shows highly relevant product offers.

---

## ⚡ Core Idea

> “Show the right product to the right user at the right time — with the right price.”

---

## 🔥 Key Features

### 🧠 AdSync Engine (Core Innovation)

* Tracks real-time user behavior
* Uses a scoring system to detect interest
* Runs on a **5-layer interaction cycle**
* Resets after each cycle for accuracy

---

### 🎯 Behavior Tracking System

Tracks:

* 👁️ Product Views
* 👆 Clicks
* 🛒 Add to Cart
* ❌ Remove from Cart

Each action contributes to a **score-based engine**

---

### ⚡ Smart Product Detection

* Identifies most relevant product using scoring
* Prioritizes:

  * High interaction products
  * User preferred categories

---

### 💸 Dynamic Pricing System

* Personalized discounts based on interest level

| Scenario                   | Discount   |
| -------------------------- | ---------- |
| High Interest              | up to 20%  |
| Medium Interest            | ~10–15%    |
| Already Discounted Product | extra 3–5% |

✅ Always applies discount on **offerPrice if available**
❌ Never uses original price incorrectly

---

### 🎁 Airdrop Offer System

* Selected product is sent as a **limited-time offer**
* Duration: **1 hour**
* Stored in user’s cart as an **airdrop**

---

### 🔁 Smart Cycle Reset

After an ad is generated:

* Clears all activity data
* Prevents biased recommendations
* Starts fresh tracking cycle

---

### 🛡️ Secure Backend System

* Built with **Node.js + Express**
* Uses **Firebase Firestore**
* Role-based data protection
* Backend-driven logic (no frontend manipulation)

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

* React.js
* CSS
* Firebase SDK

### Backend

* Node.js
* Express.js
* Firebase Admin SDK

### Database

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User interacts with products
2. System tracks last 5 actions
3. Assigns scores to products
4. Finds highest scoring product
5. Applies dynamic pricing
6. Sends product as a timed **airdrop**
7. Clears activity → restarts cycle
